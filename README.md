# FlappyBird
Here I remade a project for the famous game FlappyBird as an exercise in using the pygame library. It doesn't have all the features, but it's enough so I don't need to download it from the playstore.

# Instalation
Before running the game, you need to install the Pygame library.

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Open the terminal and execute the following command to install Pygame:

   ```bash
   pip install pygame
   python FlappyBird.py
   ```
